# Spam Filter Classifier using Machine Learning

The **Spam Filter Classifier** is a machine learning project aimed at identifying spam emails with high accuracy. Utilizing various Python libraries, this project preprocesses email datasets, visualizes patterns, and builds a classifier to distinguish between spam and non-spam emails, thereby enhancing email security and improving user experience.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess email data using NumPy and Pandas.
- **Data Visualization**: Explore and visualize email characteristics with Seaborn and Matplotlib.
- **Model Building**: Use Scikit-learn to build and evaluate the spam filter classifier.
- **High Accuracy**: Achieve high accuracy in classifying emails as spam or not.

## Built With

- **Python**: The core programming language used.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations and data processing.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Scikit-learn**: For building and evaluating machine learning models.
- **Matplotlib**: For creating static, interactive, and animated visualizations.
- **Seaborn**: For statistical data visualization.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/spam-filter-classifier.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd spam-filter-classifier
    ```
3. Install the required libraries:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Running the Application

To start the application, run:
```bash
python spam_filter.py
```

## Usage

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Load and preprocess the email dataset using NumPy and Pandas.
2. **Data Visualization**: Use Seaborn and Matplotlib to visualize email characteristics and patterns.
3. **Model Building**: Train and evaluate the spam filter classifier using Scikit-learn.
4. **Classification**: Classify new emails as spam or not spam using the trained model.
